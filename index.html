					<h2>Welcome</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout American history, Supreme Court decisions have played a pivotal role in both advancing and hindering the civil rights of African Americans; landmark cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson, Brown v. Board of Education, and Loving v. Virginia reflect the evolving interpretation of constitutional principles and illustrate how the judiciary has been both a tool of systemic oppression and a catalyst for racial justice.This project explores how landmark Supreme Court
						decisions have shaped the legal, social, and political
						lives of African Americans from the 19th century to
						today. Through an interactive timeline and case studies,
						users will uncover the evolving role of the judiciary in
						civil rights.

							<h4>Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)</h4>
							<div class="case-study-wrapper">
								<div>
									<h5>Summary:</h5>
									<p>
										The Court ruled that African Americans,
										whether enslaved or free, could not be
										U.S. citizens and had no right to sue in
										federal court. It also declared the
										Missouri Compromise unconstitutional,
										reinforcing slavery’s expansion.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Decision:</h5>
									<p>7–2 against Dred Scott</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Significance:</h5>
									<p>
										This case denied Black Americans any
										legal standing and inflamed tensions
										that led to the Civil War. It remains
										one of the most infamously racist
										rulings in U.S. legal history.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)</h4>
							<div class="case-study-wrapper">
								<div>
									<h5>Summary:</h5>
									<p>
										The Court upheld a Louisiana law
										requiring separate railway cars for
										Black and white passengers, introducing
										the doctrine of “separate but equal”
										that justified racial segregation for
										over half a century.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Decision:</h5>
									<p>7–1 in favor of segregation</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Significance:</h5>
									<p>
										Legitimized Jim Crow laws across the
										South and institutionalized racial
										discrimination in public life until the
										civil rights movement of the 1960s.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</h4>
							<div class="case-study-wrapper">
								<div>
									<h5>Summary:</h5>
									<p>
										The Court unanimously overturned Plessy,
										declaring that separate educational
										facilities for Black and white students
										are inherently unequal and violate the
										Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
										Amendment.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Decision:</h5>
									<p>9–0 in favor of desegregation</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Significance:</h5>
									<p>
										A watershed moment for the civil rights
										movement, this ruling ignited nationwide
										efforts to desegregate schools and
										challenge systemic racism.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Loving v. Virginia (1967)</h4>
							<div class="case-study-wrapper">
								<div>
									<h5>Summary:</h5>
									<p>
										The Court struck down Virginia’s ban on
										interracial marriage, finding that such
										laws violated both the Equal Protection
										and Due Process Clauses of the 14th
										Amendment.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Decision:</h5>
									<p>9–0 in favor of the Lovings</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Significance:</h5>
									<p>
										Affirmed the constitutional right to
										marry across racial lines and set a key
										precedent for later marriage equality
										cases.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>
								Regents of the University of California v. Bakke
								(1978)
							</h4>
							<div class="case-study-wrapper">
								<div>
									<h5>Summary:</h5>
									<p>
										The Court ruled that explicit racial
										quotas in college admissions violate the
										Equal Protection Clause but allowed race
										to be considered as one factor in
										admissions decisions.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Decision:</h5>
									<p>
										Split decision — upheld Bakke’s claim
										but supported limited use of affirmative
										action
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Significance:</h5>
									<p>
										Introduced legal boundaries for
										affirmative action policies and sparked
										ongoing debates about race and fairness
										in education.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Grutter v. Bollinger (2003)</h4>
							<div class="case-study-wrapper">
								<div>
									<h5>Summary:</h5>
									<p>
										The Court upheld the University of
										Michigan Law School’s policy of
										considering race as one of many factors
										in admissions, supporting diversity as a
										compelling state interest.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Decision:</h5>
									<p>5–4 in favor of the university</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Significance:</h5>
									<p>
										Reinforced affirmative action policies
										and validated efforts to create diverse
										educational environments, but set the
										stage for future legal challenges.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Shelby County v. Holder (2013)</h4>
							<div class="case-study-wrapper">
								<div>
									<h5>Summary:</h5>
									<p>
										The Court struck down the coverage
										formula in the Voting Rights Act that
										required jurisdictions with histories of
										voter discrimination to seek federal
										approval before changing voting laws.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Decision:</h5>
									<p>5–4 against preclearance</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h5>Significance:</h5>
									<p>
										Gutted a core protection of the Voting
										Rights Act, enabling states to pass
										restrictive voting laws. Widely
										criticized for increasing voter
										suppression risks.
